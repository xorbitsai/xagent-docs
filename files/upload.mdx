# File Upload

Upload files to your task workspace so agents can access and process them during execution.

## Upload Methods

### From Task Page

When creating a task on the Task page:

1. **Click the attachment icon** - File upload button
2. **Select files** - Choose files from your device
3. **Add to task** - Files are attached to your task request

**Multiple files:** You can upload multiple files at once

### Drag and Drop

Simply drag and drop files onto the Task page:
- Drag files from your file manager
- Drop onto the task input area
- Files are automatically attached

## File Size Limits

### Default Limits

- **Maximum file size** - Typically 10-100MB per file
- **Total upload size** - Varies by plan
- **Recommendations** - Compress large files before uploading

### Handling Large Files

If your file exceeds the limit:
- **Compress** - Use ZIP compression
- **Split** - Divide large files into smaller chunks
- **Optimize** - Reduce image resolution or remove unnecessary data

<Info>
Upload limits depend on your Xagent configuration and plan. Contact your administrator for specific limits.

## Upload Process

### Step 1: Select Files

Choose files from your device:
- Click file upload button or drag & drop
- Select one or multiple files
- Files appear in upload queue

### Step 2: Upload Progress

Files are uploaded to your task workspace:
- **Progress indicator** - Shows upload status
- **Success confirmation** - Files ready for use
- **Error handling** - Failed uploads show error message

### Step 3: Submit Task

With files attached:
- **Describe your task** - Tell Xagent what to do with the files
- **Submit task** - Files are stored in task workspace
- **Execution begins** - Agent can now access files

## During Task Execution

### File Access

Once uploaded and task is submitted:
- Files are stored in task workspace
- Agent can access files automatically
- Agent decides when and how to use files
- Files remain available throughout task execution

### Agent File Operations

Agent can:
- **Read** - Access file contents for analysis
- **Parse** - Extract text and data from documents
- **Process** - Analyze and transform content
- **Create** - Generate new files as output

### File References

You can reference uploaded files in your request:

```
User: [Uploads sales_data.csv, product_info.pdf]
User: "Analyze the sales data and create a presentation
        incorporating information from the product PDF"

Agent:
1. Reads sales_data.csv to understand data structure
2. Reads product_info.pdf for product details
3. Analyzes data and extracts key information
4. Creates PowerPoint presentation
5. Saves presentation to workspace
```

## Best Practices

### File Preparation

**Before uploading:**
- Use clear, descriptive filenames
- Organize related content in single files when possible
- Remove sensitive or confidential information
- Compress large files
- Check file size limits

**Good examples:**
- `sales_q4_2023.csv` - Descriptive name
- `contract_vendor_acme.pdf` - Clear identification
- `code_review_main.py` - Purpose in name

**Less effective:**
- `data.csv` - Not descriptive
- `file1.pdf` - No context
- `document.txt` - Generic name

### Multiple Files

**When uploading multiple files:**
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Group related files
- Provide context in task description
- Consider upload order if it matters

**Example:**
```
User: [Uploads q1_sales.xlsx, q2_sales.xlsx, q3_sales.xlsx, q4_sales.xlsx]
User: "These are quarterly sales files for 2023. Analyze trends
        across all quarters and create a comprehensive report."
```

### Task Descriptions

**Help the agent understand your files:**

Instead of:
```
"Process these files"
```

Try:
```
"Analyze the sales data in sales_2023.csv and create a visualization
showing monthly trends. Use the brand guidelines in brand.pdf
for the presentation style."
```

## Troubleshooting

- File size within limits
- File format is supported
- Network connection is stable
- Sufficient storage space

**Solutions:**
- Compress large files
- Try different format
- Check internet connection
- Contact administrator if issue persists

### File Not Found During Task

**Possible reasons:**
- File upload didn't complete
- File was deleted from workspace
- Wrong file path used by agent

**Solutions:**
- Verify upload completed successfully
- Check file appears in attachments
- Resubmit task with files

### Can't Upload File Type

**Workarounds:**
- Convert to supported format
- Compress multiple files into ZIP
- Extract text and upload as text file
- Contact administrator about format support
