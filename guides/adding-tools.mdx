# Adding Tools

Tools give agents the ability to take actions — searching the web, querying databases, calling APIs, and more.

## What Are Tools?

Tools are capabilities that agents can use to accomplish tasks:

    Web Search, Database Query, File Reader
  </Card>
  <Card

    Email, Slack, Webhooks, HTTP Requests
  </Card>
  <Card

    Python, SQL, Excel, Data Analysis
  </Card>
  <Card

    Calendar, Tasks, Notes, Reminders
  </Card>
</Columns>

## Built-in Tools

Xagent includes commonly-used tools:

### Web Search

Search the web and retrieve current information.

**Use for:** Research, competitive analysis, news gathering, fact-checking

### Database Query

Query SQL databases directly.

**Use for:** Business intelligence, reporting, data retrieval

### File Operations

Read, write, and manipulate files.

**Use for:** Document processing, report generation, data export

### Code Execution

Run Python code for analysis and automation.

**Use for:** Data processing, calculations, transformations

## Adding Tools to Agents

### Step 1: Access Agent Configuration

Navigate to your agent and go to **Tools**.

### Step 2: Enable Required Tools

Toggle on the tools your agent needs.

### Step 3: Configure Tool Settings

Some tools require configuration:

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="Database Connections">
    Provide connection details (host, port, credentials)
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem title="API Keys">
    Add authentication for external services
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem title="File Access">
    Specify which directories the agent can access
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>

### Step 4: Test the Agent

Verify the agent uses tools appropriately:

```
"Search for recent AI industry news and summarize the top 3 stories"
```

## Custom Tools

Connect your own APIs and services as tools.

### REST APIs

Wrap any REST API as a tool:

```json
{
  "name": "crm_search",
  "description": "Search the CRM for customer information",
  "endpoint": "https://api.yourcrm.com/search",
  "method": "POST",
  "authentication": "bearer_token"
}
```

### Custom Functions

Write custom logic in Python:

```python
def calculate_pricing(quantity, customer_tier):
    """Calculate pricing based on quantity and customer tier"""
    base_price = 100
    if customer_tier == "enterprise":
        return base_price * quantity * 0.7
    return base_price * quantity
```

See [API Reference](/api-reference/introduction) for details on custom tools.

## Tool Selection

Xagent automatically selects the right tools for each task. You don't need to specify which tools to use when — just enable them and the agent will choose appropriately.

### Example

With Web Search and Database Query enabled:

```
User: "What are our Q3 sales figures?"

Agent: [Uses Database Query to retrieve sales data]
```

```
User: "What are competitors saying about this feature?"

Agent: [Uses Web Search to find public information]
```

## Tool Best Practices

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="Start Essential">
    Only enable tools the agent actually needs. Too many options can reduce performance.
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem title="Provide Context">
    Clear tool descriptions help agents choose the right tool.
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem title="Secure Configuration">
    Use environment variables for sensitive data (API keys, passwords).
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem title="Error Handling">
    Design tools to provide clear error messages when operations fail.
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>
