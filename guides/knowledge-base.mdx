# Knowledge Base

Connect your documents, data, and knowledge so agents can use them to answer questions and provide context.

## What Is Knowledge Base?

A knowledge base gives agents access to:
- Company documentation
- Technical manuals
- Research papers
- Policies and procedures
- Product information

Agents can search, retrieve, and reference this knowledge when responding to queries.

## How It Works

1. **Upload Documents** — Add PDFs, Word docs, text files, or connect to data sources
2. **Automatic Indexing** — Xagent indexes and makes content searchable
3. **Semantic Retrieval** — Agents find relevant information based on meaning, not just keywords
4. **Contextual Responses** — Agents use retrieved knowledge to generate accurate answers

## Setting Up Knowledge Base

### Step 1: Navigate to Knowledge Base

Go to **Knowledge** in the sidebar.

### Step 2: Create a Collection

Organize related documents into collections:

- Product Documentation
- Company Policies
- Technical Guides
- Research Papers

### Step 3: Add Documents

Upload files or connect to external sources:

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="File Upload">
    Direct upload of PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD files
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem title="Web Scraping">
    Crawl and index websites or documentation portals
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem title="Database Connection">
    Connect to existing databases and document stores
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem title="API Integration">
    Pull from external systems via API
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>

### Step 4: Assign to Agents

Select which agents can access each collection.

## Use Cases

### Customer Support Agent

Connect:
- Product documentation
- FAQs
- Troubleshooting guides
- Policy documents

Result: Agent answers questions accurately using official documentation.

### Technical Assistant

Connect:
- API references
- Code examples
- Architecture docs
- Runbooks

Result: Agent helps with technical tasks using up-to-date information.

### HR Assistant

Connect:
- Employee handbook
- Benefits information
- Policy documents
- Forms and templates

Result: Agent provides accurate HR guidance 24/7.

### Research Analyst

Connect:
- Industry reports
- Academic papers
- Market research
- Internal studies

Result: Agent synthesizes information from multiple sources.

## Best Practices

  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem title="Provide Context">
    Include metadata about when documents were last updated.
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>

## Managing Access

### Agent-Level Access

Assign specific collections to each agent based on its purpose:
- Support agents get product docs
- Sales agents get pricing and competitive info
- HR agents get policy documents

### User-Level Access

Control who can query which knowledge:
- Role-based access control
- Team-based collections
- Personal knowledge bases

## Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

Xagent uses RAG to improve accuracy:

1. **Retrieve** — Find relevant documents based on the query
2. **Augment** — Use retrieved content as context
3. **Generate** — Produce answers grounded in the retrieved information

This ensures responses are:
- **Accurate** — Based on your actual documentation
- **Citable** — Sources can be referenced
- **Updatable** — Update documents to update agent knowledge
