# Creating Agents

Learn how to design and build effective agents for any use case.

## Agent Basics

An agent in Xagent is defined by:
- **Purpose** — What it should accomplish
- **Capabilities** — Tools and knowledge it can access
- **Constraints** — Boundaries and guidelines

## Define the Purpose

Start with a clear, specific description:

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="Too Vague">
    "A helpful assistant"
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem title="Better">
    "A research assistant that searches the web, summarizes findings, and cites sources"
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem title="Best">
    "A research assistant for competitive analysis that:
    - Searches multiple sources (web, databases, reports)
    - Synthesizes information into structured reports
    - Provides citations and source links
    - Identifies gaps in available information"
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>

## Agent Configuration

### 1. Basic Settings

```
Name: Competitive Intelligence Agent
Description: [Your detailed description]
Model: GPT-4 (recommended for complex tasks)
```

### 2. Select Tools

Choose tools based on the agent's purpose:

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="Research & Analysis"
    icon="search"
  >
    Web Search, Database Query, File Reader
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Data Processing"
    icon="table"
  >
    Python, SQL, Excel, Data Visualization
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Communication"
    icon="message-square"
  >
    Email, Slack, Webhooks
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Productivity"
    icon="zap"
  >
    Calendar, Task Management, Notes
  </Card>
</Columns>

### 3. Add Knowledge Base

For domain-specific agents, connect relevant documents:

- Product documentation
- Company policies
- Technical manuals
- Research papers

See [Knowledge Base](/guides/knowledge-base) for details.

### 4. Set Constraints

Define boundaries to keep the agent focused:

```
The agent should:
- Only search within specified domains
- Verify information from multiple sources
- Flag uncertain information
- Stay within defined scope
```

## Agent Patterns

### Research Agent

```
Purpose: Conduct deep research and synthesize findings
Tools: Web Search, Database, File Reader
Constraints: Cite sources, verify claims, comprehensive coverage
```

### Data Analyst

```
Purpose: Analyze data and generate insights
Tools: SQL, Python, Visualization
Constraints: Use provided data only, explain methodology
```

### Content Creator

```
Purpose: Generate written content and presentations
Tools: Web Search, File Writer, Templates
Constraints: Follow brand guidelines, factual accuracy
```

### Automation Agent

```
Purpose: Execute workflows and integrate systems
Tools: APIs, Database, Webhooks
Constraints: Error handling, logging, approval gates
```

## Testing Your Agent

### Start Simple

Test with basic tasks to ensure the agent understands its role:

```
"Summarize the main features of Xagent"
```

### Increase Complexity

Gradually test more complex scenarios:

```
"Research three competitors in the AI agent space and create a comparison table"
```

### Validate Output

Check that the agent:
- Stays within its defined scope
- Uses available tools appropriately
- Produces consistent, reliable results
- Handles errors gracefully

## Iteration Tips

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="Clarify the Purpose">
    If the agent is unfocused, refine the description with more specific guidance.
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem title="Add or Remove Tools">
    Too many tools can confuse the agent. Start with the essentials.
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem title="Adjust Constraints">
    If the agent goes off-track, add clearer boundaries.
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem title="Test Edge Cases">
    Try unusual inputs to ensure the agent handles them gracefully.
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>

## Best Practices

1. **Start Small** — Build a simple agent first, then add complexity
2. **Be Specific** — Clear descriptions lead to better performance
3. **Test Thoroughly** — Validate with real use cases
4. **Iterate** — Refine based on feedback and usage
5. **Monitor** — Track performance and user satisfaction
