# Quick Win: Your First Agent

Create your first agent in just a few minutes — no coding required.

## What We'll Build

A simple assistant that can:
- Answer questions using web search
- Summarize information
- Help with research tasks

## Prerequisites

- Xagent running (see [Quick Start](/quickstart))
- Basic understanding of prompts

## Step 1: Create the Agent

1. Navigate to **Agents** in the sidebar
2. Click **New Agent**
3. Give it a name: "Research Assistant"
4. Add a description:

```
A helpful assistant that can search the web, research topics, and summarize information clearly and concisely.
```

## Step 2: Configure Tools

Enable **Web Search** to give your agent access to current information.

1. In the agent configuration, go to **Tools**
2. Enable **Web Search**
3. Save your changes

## Step 3: Test Your Agent

That's it! Your agent is ready to use.

Try these prompts:

```
"What are the latest developments in AI agents?"
"Summarize the key features of Python 3.12"
"Find information about renewable energy trends in 2024"
```

## What Just Happened

You created an agent without:
- Writing any code
- Designing workflows
- Configuring complex integrations

You simply:
1. Described what the agent should do
2. Enabled the tools it needs
3. Started using it

Xagent handled the rest.
