# Image Generation Models

Image generation models enable Xagent to create and modify images through text prompts.

## Purpose

**Enable Image Tools:**
- `generate_image` - Create images from text descriptions
- `edit_image` - Modify existing images
- Visual content creation and editing

**How it works:**
- Accept text prompts describing desired image
- Generate new images or modify existing ones
- Return image files saved to workspace

## When to Use

**Required for:**
- Image generation tasks
- Image editing and modification
- Visual content creation
- Design and marketing materials

**Not required for:**
- Image understanding or analysis (uses Vision LLMs)
- Image OCR or text extraction (uses Vision LLMs)
- Chart/graph analysis (uses Vision LLMs)

## Supported Providers

### OpenAI & OpenAI-compatible

**Models:** gpt-image-1 and compatible models

**Setup:**
1. Get API key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com)
2. For compatible services, provide base URL and API key
3. Select image model

**Abilities:** Both "generate" and "edit"

**Best for:**
- High-quality image generation
- Creative tasks
- Marketing materials
- Wide compatibility

### DashScope (Alibaba Cloud)

**Models:** qwen-image

**Setup:**
1. Get API key from [DashScope Console](https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com)
2. Configure API key
3. Select model

**Abilities:** Primarily "generate" (can support "edit")

**Best for:**
- Chinese language optimization
- Cost-effective for Asian markets
- Alibaba Cloud integration

**Supported formats:**
- JPG, JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF, WEBP
- Max file size: 10MB for editing

### Xinference

**Models:** Stable Diffusion variants (stable-diffusion-2-1, etc.)

**Setup:**
1. Deploy Xinference server
2. Launch image generation model
3. Configure base URL in Xagent
4. Select model from Xinference

**Abilities:** Configurable (default: ["generate"], supports "edit")

**Best for:**
- Self-hosted deployment
- Data privacy
- Cost control
- Using open-source models

**Features:**
- List available models from server
- Support for various Stable Diffusion models
- Image-to-image and inpainting capabilities

## Configuration

### Step 1: Add Image Provider

1. Go to **Models** in the sidebar
2. Click **Add Model** or **Add Provider**
3. Select image generation provider
4. Enter API credentials

### Step 2: Configure Model

1. Select the image model
2. Configure parameters:
   - Image size (e.g., 1024*1024, 1792*1024)
   - Response format (url or b64_json)
   - Number of images (n)
3. Test generation

### Step 3: Set Abilities

Image models can have these abilities:
- **generate** - Create new images from text
- **edit** - Modify existing images

<Info>
Not all image models support both generation and editing. Check provider documentation.

## Usage Examples

### Generating Images

```
User: "Create a promotional poster for a coffee shop"
Xagent: [Uses generate_image tool]
[Generates image based on description, saves to workspace]
```

### Editing Images

```
User: "Change the color scheme to warm tones"
Xagent: [Uses edit_image tool]
[Modifies existing image, saves to workspace]
```

### Multi-Image Editing

```
User: "Combine these two images with a sunset background"
Xagent: [Uses edit_image tool with multiple images]
[Edits multiple images into one result]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Generation Failed

**Check:**
- API key is valid
- Model supports generation ability
- Prompt follows guidelines
- Content policy violations

### Poor Quality

**Try:**
- Improving prompt specificity
- Adding style instructions
- Using negative prompts
- Trying different model
- Adjusting image size

### Slow Generation

**Optimize:**
- Reduce image size
- Consider faster model
- Check network connectivity

### Edits Not Working

**Verify:**
- Model supports edit ability
- Edit instructions are clear
- Original image is accessible
- Image format is supported
- File size within limits (DashScope: 10MB)

### File Not Found

**Check:**
- Image path is correct
- File exists in workspace
- Use workspace file browser to verify path
- URL is accessible

## Security & Privacy

**Important considerations:**
- Generated images are saved to workspace
- Check provider's data retention policy
- Be aware of content policies
- Copyright and usage rights

**Recommendations:**
- Review provider content policy
- Ensure rights to generated content
- Consider compliance requirements
- Be mindful of copyright
