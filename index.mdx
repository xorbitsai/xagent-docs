# Xagent

## Describe tasks. Not workflows.

**No more flowcharts.**
**No more rigid automation.**
**Just tell Xagent what you want.**

![Xagent Interface](/images/introduction.png)

## Examples

```bash
# Just tell Xagent what to do
"Research the latest AI developments and write a summary"
"Create a 10-slide presentation about renewable energy"
"Design a promotional poster for a coffee shop"
```

Xagent plans, decomposes, selects tools, executes, and iterates automatically.

## The Problem

**Workflow builders are rigid. They break when requirements change.**

- You map every decision branch manually
- You orchestrate tools by hand
- You maintain fragile flow diagrams
- You re-engineer when logic changes

## The Xagent Way

**With Xagent, you describe the outcome — not the steps.**

- Plans the task dynamically
- Decomposes into executable steps
- Selects the right tools automatically
- Executes, evaluates, and iterates

## Not a Workflow Builder

**Xagent is not:**
- A drag-and-drop flow editor
- A static template engine
- A chatbot wrapper

**Xagent is:**
- A dynamic task execution engine
- An autonomous planning system
- A foundation for building real AI agents
