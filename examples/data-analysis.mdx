# Data Analysis

Build agents that can analyze data, generate insights, and create reports automatically.

## What It Does

A Data Analysis Agent can:
- Process structured and unstructured data
- Perform statistical analysis
- Generate visualizations and charts
- Create automated reports

"Analyze Q3 sales data and create a report showing:
1. Revenue by region and product line
2. Month-over-month growth trends
3. Top performing products and underperforming segments
4. Recommendations for Q4 strategy"
```
