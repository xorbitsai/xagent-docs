# Research Agent

Build AI agents that autonomously conduct research, synthesize information, and generate comprehensive reports.

## What It Does

A Research Agent can:
- Search and gather information from multiple sources
- Analyze and synthesize findings
- Generate structured reports with citations
- Follow research methodologies automatically

## How It Works

With Xagent, you don't design the research workflow. You simply describe the research goal:

```
"Research the AI agent market and create a comprehensive report covering:
1. Key players and their offerings
2. Market size and growth projections
3. Technical trends and innovations
4. Competitive landscape analysis"
```

Xagent will:
1. **Plan** the research approach
2. **Search** across multiple sources
3. **Analyze** and cross-reference findings
4. **Synthesize** into a structured report
