# Knowledge Base Overview

The Knowledge Base (KB) enables you to enhance your agents with domain-specific information, making them more accurate and useful for specialized tasks.

## What is Knowledge Base?

A knowledge base is a collection of documents and data that your agent can reference when answering questions or executing tasks. Instead of relying solely on pre-trained knowledge, agents can access your proprietary information.
