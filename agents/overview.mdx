# Agents Overview

Agents are reusable AI assistants with predefined roles and configurations. Unlike one-time tasks, agents maintain consistent behavior and can be shared across your team.

## Agent vs Task

### When to Use Tasks

**Tasks** are best for:
- One-time executions
- Quick exploratory work
- Testing ideas
- Ad-hoc requests
- Temporary workflows

**Example:** "Summarize this document" - a one-time request that doesn't need to be saved or reused.

### When to Use Agents

**Agents** are best for:
- Reusable workflows
- Repeated operations
- Team collaboration
- Production use cases
- Specialized roles

**Example:** A "Customer Support Agent" that handles FAQ requests, searches documentation, and provides consistent responses.

### Comparison

| Feature | Tasks | Agents |
|---------|-------|--------|
| **Use case** | One-time executions | Reusable workflows |
| **Configuration** | Auto-generated | Customizable |
| **Persistence** | Not saved | Saved and shareable |
| **Behavior** | Varies by request | Consistent |
| **Sharing** | Not shareable | Can be published |
| **Role definition** | Per task | Predefined |

## Key Agent Features

### 1. Role Definition

Define your agent's purpose and behavior:
- "You are a customer support assistant"
- "You are a data analyst"
- "You are a research assistant"

### 2. Execution Mode

Choose how your agent processes tasks:
- **React Mode**: Reasoning → Acting cycle (default)
- **Graph Mode**: Plan all steps first, then execute

### 3. Tool Access

Control what tools your agent can use:
- Basic tools (web search, calculator)
- File operations
- Image understanding/generation
- Knowledge base operations
- And more

### 4. Knowledge Integration

Add domain-specific knowledge:
- Attach knowledge bases
- Agent retrieves relevant information
- Enhances response accuracy

### 5. Model Configuration

Select models for different purposes:
- **General Model**: Main reasoning engine
- **Fast Model**: For simple operations
- **Visual Model**: For image tasks
- **Compact Model**: For long conversations

## How It Works

### Creating Tasks

For one-time tasks, simply:
1. Go to **Task** page
2. Enter your request
3. Upload files if needed
4. Xagent executes and shows results

### Creating Agents

For reusable workflows:
1. Go to **Build** page
2. Create new agent
3. Configure role, models, tools, knowledge
4. Test with live preview
5. Save and publish

After publishing, users can:
- Find the agent in the agents list
- Start a conversation with the agent
- Agent uses its configured behavior consistently

### Shared Execution Interface

Both tasks and agents use the same execution interface:
- Real-time progress tracking
- Step-by-step execution details
- Tool calls and responses
- Chat interaction

When using an agent, the interface displays:
- Agent's logo and name
- Agent's configuration
- Consistent behavior based on agent's settings

## Typical Workflow

### For One-Time Tasks

```
Task Page → Enter Request → Execution → Results
```

**Done!** No need to save or configure anything.

### For Creating Agents

```
Build Page → Create Agent → Configure → Test → Save → Publish
```

After publishing:
```
Agents List → Select Agent → Chat → Agent responds with configured behavior
```

## Agent Templates

Jump-start agent creation with pre-built templates:
- **Customer Support**: FAQ handling, documentation search
- **Data Analyst**: Data processing, visualization, reporting
- **Research Assistant**: Information gathering, synthesis
- **Content Creator**: Writing, editing, image generation

Templates provide a starting point that you can customize for your specific needs.
