# Building Agents

Learn how to create, configure, and publish custom agents for your specific needs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before building an agent, ensure you have:
- **At least one LLM configured** - Required for agent to function
- **Optional**: Knowledge bases, skills, or custom tools
- **Optional**: Image generation models for visual tasks

## Creating an Agent

### Step 1: Navigate to Build Page

Go to **Build** in the left sidebar to access the agent management interface.

### Step 2: Create New Agent

Click **New Agent** to open the agent configuration editor.

The editor has a two-column layout:
- **Left panel**: Configuration options
- **Right panel**: Live preview chat interface

## Agent Configuration

### Basic Information

**Name** (Required)
- Maximum 200 characters
- Must be unique within your account
- Choose a descriptive name for your agent

**Description** (Optional)
- Brief explanation of what the agent does
- Helps users understand the agent's purpose

**Logo** (Optional)
- Upload an image to represent your agent
- Displayed in agent listings and chat interface

### Execution Mode

Choose how your agent processes tasks:

**React Mode** (Default)
- ReAct loop: Reasoning → Acting cycle
- Best for: Most general-purpose tasks
- Agent thinks, takes action, observes results, repeats

**Graph Mode**
- DAG planning-execution
- Best for: Complex, multi-step workflows
- Agent plans all steps first, then executes

<Info>
Use React mode for most tasks. Switch to Graph mode for complex workflows that require careful planning.
</Info>

### AI Models

Configure models for different purposes:

**General Model** (Required)
- The main LLM for all task execution
- Handles planning, reasoning, and decision making
- Example: Claude 4.6 Sonnet, GPT 5.2

**Fast Model** (Optional)
- Lightweight model for simple operations
- Reduces cost and improves speed
- Automatically used for simple steps identified during planning

**Visual Model** (Optional)
- Multimodal LLM for image understanding
- Required for image-related tasks
- Enables tools like `understand_images`, `describe_images`

**Compact Model** (Optional)
- Specialized model for compressing long conversations
- Maintains context across extended sessions
- Triggered when conversation exceeds token threshold

### Capabilities

**Knowledge Bases** (Optional)
- Add domain-specific knowledge to your agent
- Agent can search and retrieve relevant information
- Upload documents or select existing knowledge bases

**Skills** (Optional)
- Pre-built capabilities for specific tasks
- Enhance agent with specialized functionality
- Examples: Web search, database operations

**Tools** (Optional)
- Select tool categories to enable:
  - **basic**: Basic tools (web search, calculator, etc.)
  - **file**: File upload and management
  - **vision**: Image understanding
  - **image**: Image generation and editing
  - **knowledge**: Knowledge base operations
  - **mcp**: MCP protocol tools
  - **browser**: Browser automation
  - **ppt**: PowerPoint processing
  - **office**: Office document processing

<Info>
Tools are automatically enabled based on selected categories. Agent will only have access to tools in chosen categories.
</Info>

### Suggested Prompts

Provide example prompts to help users get started:
- "Analyze this sales data and create a report"
- "Generate a marketing plan for our new product"
- "Review these documents and summarize key points"

These prompts appear as suggestions when users chat with your agent.

## Testing Your Agent

### Live Preview

Use the preview panel on the right to test your agent in real-time:

1. **Type a message** in the chat input
2. **Send and observe** how your agent responds
3. **Upload files** to test file handling
4. **Iterate** on configuration based on results

The preview uses your current configuration without saving:
- Test different settings before committing
- See immediate results
- Verify tool access and knowledge retrieval

<Info>
Preview mode creates a temporary execution environment. Changes are only saved when you click Save.
</Info>

### What to Test

- **Response quality**: Does the agent understand the task?
- **Tool usage**: Are the right tools being used?
- **Knowledge retrieval**: Does it find relevant information?
- **Execution mode**: React vs Graph behavior
- **Model selection**: Are the configured models working?

## Saving Your Agent

### Auto-Save

Your configuration is automatically validated but not saved until you explicitly save.

### Manual Save

Click **Save** to persist your agent configuration:
- Agent is saved with **draft** status
- Only you can see and edit draft agents
- Saved agents appear in your Build page list

### Editing Existing Agents

1. Go to **Build** page
2. Click **Edit** on the agent card
3. Make changes to configuration
4. Click **Save** to update

## Publishing Your Agent

### When to Publish

Publish your agent when:
- Configuration is complete and tested
- Ready to share with others
- Production-ready workflows

### Publishing Process

1. **Save** your agent first
2. Click **Publish** button
3. Agent status changes from **draft** to **published**
4. Publication timestamp is recorded
5. Agent becomes visible to authorized users

### Unpublishing

To unpublish an agent:
1. Go to **Build** page
2. Click **Unpublish** on the published agent
3. Agent status returns to **draft**
4. Agent is no longer accessible to users

<Info>
Unpublishing doesn't delete the agent. You can republish it later.
</Info>

## Chatting with Your Agent

### Starting a Conversation

Once published, users can chat with your agent:

1. **Find the agent** in the agents list
2. **Click on the agent** to open its detail page
3. **Type a message** or use a suggested prompt
4. **Agent responds** using its configuration

### Agent Execution

When chatting, the agent:
- Uses its **configured models** for reasoning
- Follows its **execution mode** (React or Graph)
- Accesses **enabled tools** based on tool categories
- Retrieves information from **knowledge bases**
- Applies its **instructions** and **skills**

### Task Creation

Each conversation creates a task:
- Task is linked to the agent
- Execution uses agent's configuration
- Results are saved in task history
- Can view full execution trace

## Agent Templates

### Using Templates

Jump-start agent creation with pre-built templates:
1. Go to **Build** page
2. Click **New Agent**
3. Select a template
4. Template populates configuration
5. Customize as needed

### Available Templates

Common agent templates include:
- **Customer Support**: FAQ handling, documentation search
- **Data Analyst**: Data processing, visualization, reporting
- **Research Assistant**: Information gathering, synthesis
- **Content Creator**: Writing, editing, image generation

<Info>
Templates provide starting points. Always test and customize for your specific use case.
</Info>

## Best Practices

### Start Simple

- Begin with React mode for most use cases
- Enable only necessary tool categories
- Add knowledge bases after testing basic functionality
- Use preview to iterate quickly

### Define Clear Purpose

- Specific name and description
- Focused skill set
- Relevant suggested prompts
- Appropriate tool access

### Test Thoroughly

- Use preview before publishing
- Test with various inputs
- Verify tool access is appropriate
- Check knowledge retrieval accuracy

### Iterate and Improve

- Monitor agent performance
- Gather user feedback
- Update configuration as needed
- Republish after changes

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Not Responding

**Check:**
- General model is configured
- Model has available API quota
- Network connectivity is working

### Tools Not Available

**Verify:**
- Tool categories are selected
- Models for specific tools are configured (e.g., Visual model for vision tools)
- Tool permissions are properly set

### Knowledge Not Retrieved

**Check:**
- Knowledge bases are attached
- Documents are indexed
- Embedding model is configured
- Search queries are specific

### Preview Not Working

**Try:**
- Refreshing the page
- Re-opening the editor
- Checking browser console for errors
- Verifying model configuration
