# Task Execution

Learn how Xagent plans, executes, and manages your tasks from start to finish.

## Execution Phases

### 1. Planning Phase

When you submit a task, Xagent first analyzes your request and creates an execution plan.

**What happens:**
- Xagent understands your goal
- Breaks down the task into steps
- Identifies required tools
- Generates a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)

**The DAG (Execution Plan)**

The DAG is a visual representation of your task workflow:

![Execution Plan](/images/execution-plan.png)

**Understanding the DAG:**
- **Nodes** (circles/boxes) - Individual execution steps
- **Edges** (arrows) - Dependencies between steps
- **Flow** - Execution order from start to finish

### 2. Execution Phase

Once the plan is ready, Xagent begins executing each step.

**What happens:**
- Steps execute in dependency order
- Tools are called automatically
- Results are passed between steps
- Progress updates in real-time

**Execution features:**
- Real-time progress tracking
- Step-by-step logging
- Error handling and retry
- Dynamic adaptation

### 3. Completion Phase

After all steps complete, Xagent compiles the final result.

**What happens:**
- Results from all steps are aggregated
- Final output is generated
- Execution summary is displayed
- Task is saved for reference

## The Execution Interface

When your task runs, you'll see the **Agent Interface** with a vertical step layout:

![Task Execution Interface](/images/task-execution.png)

### Chat Area (Top)
- Your original request
- Real-time status updates
- Final results
- Follow-up conversation
- File attachments

### Execution Steps (Main Area)
- Vertical flow of execution steps
- Each step displays:
  - Step number and title
  - Agent reasoning and output
  - **Tool calls** (shown inline with step content)
  - Tool responses and results
  - Execution status indicators
- Expandable for detailed view

### Understanding Tool Calls

When a step uses tools, you'll see:

```
Step 1: Planning
[Agent reasoning about the task...]

🔧 web_search
  Query: "AI developments 2024"
  Results: [search results...]

🔧 browse_results
  URL: [specific page]
  Content: [page content...]
```

**Common tools you'll see**:
- `web_search` - Search the web for information
- `browse_results` - Read specific web pages
- `file_read` - Read uploaded files
- `code_execution` - Run code snippets
- Various API integrations

## Monitoring Execution

### Step Status Indicators

- 🔵 **Pending** - Step waiting to run
- 🟡 **Running** - Step currently executing
- 🟢 **Completed** - Step finished successfully
- 🔴 **Failed** - Step encountered an error

### Real-Time Updates

Watch your task execute:
- Steps change color as they progress
- New steps appear as dependencies resolve
- Results populate in real-time
- Tokens and time tracked

## Interacting During Execution

### Send Follow-up Messages

Add context or modify the task:
- "Focus on the European market"
- "Add more visual elements"
- "Include competitor analysis"

### Upload Files

Add more resources mid-execution:
- Click attachment icon
- Select files to upload
- Reference them in follow-up

### Cancel Execution

Stop the task if needed:
- Click cancel/stop button
- Current step completes
- Partial results saved

## Post-Execution Actions

### View Full Execution

After completion:
- Review all steps
- Check tool usage
- Analyze performance
- Export execution log

### Start New Task

Create additional tasks:
- Return to Task page
- Submit a new request
- Build on previous results
- Refine with follow-ups

## Performance Metrics

Each execution shows:

**Token Usage**
- Input tokens consumed
- Output tokens generated
- Total across all steps
- Cost estimate

**Execution Time**
- Start and end timestamps
- Duration per step
- Total execution time

**Resource Usage**
- Tools called
- Files accessed
- APIs used
- Memory consumed

## Troubleshooting

### Task Not Starting

**Check:**
- LLM provider configured
- API key valid
- Request is clear and specific

### Execution Stuck

**Solutions:**
- Wait longer (complex tasks take time)
- Check for infinite loops
- Cancel and retry
- Simplify the request

### Step Failed

**What to do:**
1. Check error message in right panel
2. Verify tool availability
3. Review input data
4. Request retry or modify approach

### DAG Not Loading

**Try:**
- Refresh the page
- Check browser console
- Clear cache
- Try different browser

## Best Practices

### 1. Be Specific

Clear requests lead to better plans:
- "Analyze Q4 sales by region and create charts"
- Not: "Analyze sales"

### 2. Break Down Complex Tasks

For very complex goals:
- Start with a high-level request
- Let Xagent create the plan
- Review the DAG
- Send follow-ups to refine

### 3. Provide Context

Give Xagent what it needs:
- Upload relevant files
- Reference specific data sources
- Set constraints and preferences
- Define output format

### 4. Monitor Progress

Watch the execution:
- Check DAG for bottlenecks
- Review step results
- Catch errors early
- Adjust as needed
