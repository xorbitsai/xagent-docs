# Tasks Overview

Tasks are the fundamental unit of work in Xagent. Simply describe what you want to accomplish, and Xagent will plan, execute, and deliver results automatically.

## What is a Task?

A task is a natural language description of a goal you want to achieve. Unlike traditional automation systems that require predefined workflows, Xagent interprets your intent and breaks it down into executable steps.

### Task Examples

```bash
# Research
"Research the latest AI developments and write a summary"

# Presentations
"Create a 10-slide presentation about renewable energy"

# Design
"Design a promotional poster for a coffee shop"
```

## Task Configuration

Before running a task, you can configure the model settings.

### Model Selection

Choose the appropriate model for your task:

**Main Model** - Used for all task execution by default
- Required for all tasks
- Handles planning, reasoning, and execution
- Used unless fast model is configured

**Fast Model** - Used for simple steps (optional)
- Automatically used for steps identified as simple during planning
- Reduces cost and improves speed for routine operations
- If not configured, main model handles all steps

**Other Model Types**:
- [Long Context Models](/models/llm) - For compressing large context windows
- [Vision Models](/models/image) - Required to use image analysis tools

**Model Settings**:
- Select from configured providers
- Adjust temperature for creativity
- Set max tokens for output length
- Configure other model parameters

## Key Features

### Natural Language Input

Describe your goal in plain language - no coding or workflow design required. Xagent understands context and intent.

### File Attachments

Upload files to provide context for your tasks:
- Documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT)
- Spreadsheets (CSV, XLSX)
- Images (PNG, JPG)
- Code files
- And more

### Real-time Execution

Watch your task execute in real-time:
- See each step as it's planned
- Monitor execution progress
- View intermediate results
- Iterate on the output

### Streaming Responses

Get results as they're generated, not just at the end. Perfect for long-running tasks where you want to see progress.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Submit your task
    Describe your goal in natural language through the Task page
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Configure model (optional)
    Select main model and fast model for the task
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Planning phase
    Xagent analyzes your request and breaks it down into steps
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Execution phase
    Each step is executed sequentially, with tool calls displayed inline
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Results delivered
    Receive the final output with the ability to iterate or refine
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Task Interface

The task interface provides:

- **Chat Input**: Natural language input area
- **Model Selector**: Choose models for this task
- **File Upload**: Attach files for context
- **Execution View**: Watch your task progress in vertical step flow
- **Results Panel**: Review outputs and artifacts
